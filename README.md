# Phi-grib internal version of non-conformist

This version is a fork of donlnz/nonconformist, respecting the original code as much as possible, but implementing two kinds of modifications
1. lambdas were replaced by regular functions to permit the serialization of the estimators
2. random_state was added in different places to make the results fully reproducible

Modifications were marked with "MP" as comments

Changes were introduced originally by José Carlos Gómez-Tamayo and further adapted by Manuel Pastor (March 2021)

# nonconformist

Python implementation of the conformal prediction framework [1].

Primarily to be used as an extension to the scikit-learn library.

API documentation: http://donlnz.github.io/nonconformist/

(API documentation is currently severely deprecated; for instructions on basic usage,
please refer to [README.ipynb](https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist/blob/master/README.ipynb), and the running examples
available under [/examples/](https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist/tree/master/examples) in the repository.)

# Installation

## Dependencies

nonconformist requires:

* Python (tested under Python 3.5)
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn

## User installation

The easiest way to install the latest release version is via ```pip```:
```bash
pip install nonconformist
```
The development version is available here on github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/donlnz/nonconformist
```
